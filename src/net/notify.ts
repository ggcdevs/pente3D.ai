/**
 * PURE #20 notify/reconnect decisions (Task N.5.1) — the DOM-free, transport-free triggers the
 * networking session GLUE (`session.ts`/`appSession.ts`) consumes to drive move notifications and the
 * background→return auto-reconnect, separated from the IO glue so it earns the strict unit + mutation
 * gate exactly like the other pure net logic (`turnGate.ts`, `netRouting.ts`, `handshake.ts`, …).
 *
 * ## What this decides (and what stays in the glue)
 *
 * This module answers three questions with pure functions:
 *
 *   1. {@link isRemoteMoveForMe} — was an adopted state change the OPPONENT's move that made it MY
 *      turn? That is the trigger for a 'your turn' notification. It is TRUE only when the move-log grew
 *      (a placement landed), the game is not won, and it is now this client's seat to move — so a self
 *      move, a non-move re-emit, an undo (log shrank), a still-opponent-turn change (a defensive
 *      multi-move / malformed-log case), and a winning move all correctly do NOT notify.
 *   2. {@link deriveMoveNotification} — given that trigger + the {@link NotificationsConfig} + whether
 *      the browser-notification permission is granted, WHICH channels fire and with WHAT copy. The copy
 *      is drawn from the enumerated {@link YOUR_TURN_BODY}/{@link YOUR_TURN_TITLE_FLASH} constants —
 *      NEVER from any opponent free text (security #20: the glue renders it via `textContent`).
 *   3. {@link shouldReconnect} — should a `visibilitychange`→visible or `online` edge trigger an
 *      auto-reconnect? TRUE only when the session is offline/dropped AND the tab just became visible or
 *      the network just came back — never when already connected/connecting/conflicted.
 *
 * The GLUE owns the SIDE EFFECTS these decisions gate: subscribing to the session's game-change seam and
 * reading the engine's ply, writing `document.title`, calling the `Notification` API + requesting its
 * permission, and re-joining the room. This module reads only plain values + the core `Player`/
 * `GameState` types + the {@link NetPhase} enum — no transport, engine, three, or DOM — so it is held to
 * the hard 100% unit-coverage + mutation floor the whole `src/net/**` scope carries.

 * Whether the state change from `prev` → `next` was the OPPONENT's move that made it MY turn — the

 * TRUE iff ALL hold:
 *   - the move-log GREW (`nextPly > prevPly`): a placement actually landed. A non-move re-emit
 *     (`nextPly === prevPly`) or an adopted undo (`nextPly < prevPly`) is not a forward opponent move;
 *   - the game is not won (`next.winner === null`): a winning move ends the game — that is the end-state
 *     overlay's job (#12), not a your-turn nudge;
 *   - it is now MY seat to move (`next.turn === mySeat`): the mover was therefore the opponent, and the
 *     turn has come to me. If a move landed yet it is STILL the opponent's turn — a defensive
 *     multi-move / malformed-log case that standard alternating-turn Pente never produces — this is
 *     false: it is not my turn, so nothing is notified.
 *
 * A held-seat check is NOT needed as a separate clause: `next.turn` is always a `Player` (`'white'` /
 * `'black'`), so `next.turn === mySeat` is already false whenever `mySeat` is `null` — the no-seat case
 * falls out of the turn comparison, and a negative test pins it (a redundant `mySeat !== null` guard is
 * deliberately omitted rather than left as an unkillable/equivalent branch).
 *
 * The BEFORE state is not needed — the only fact the trigger reads from history is the ply GROWTH,
 * passed explicitly as `prevPly`/`nextPly` (the session tracks `engine.game().ply()` across the change).
 *
 * @param next The authoritative game state AFTER the change.
 * @param mySeat This client's claimed seat, or `null` before a seat is held.
 * @param prevPly The move-log length before the change (the session tracks `engine.game().ply()`).
 * @param nextPly The move-log length after the change.
