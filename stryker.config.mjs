/**
 * StrykerJS mutation-testing config.
 *
 * SCOPE: mutate the pure, deterministic logic only — `src/core`, `src/config`,
 * `src/persist`, and the pure `src/net` logic (`seats.ts`, `sync.ts`). The IO
 * transport adapter (`src/net/transport.ts`, `mqttTransport.ts`) is deliberately NOT
 * mutated; it is verified by the real-relay integration test (Task 3.3), not by
 * mutation-testing mqtt/DOM glue. Coverage is a floor; mutation is the real bar
 * (planning/agent-principles.md — "Mutation score is the real bar").
 *
 * ENFORCED GATE: `thresholds.break = 95` → `npm run mutate` exits non-zero below 95%
 * overall. Without a `break` value Stryker defaults to no gate. Do NOT lower it to make
 * a run pass; kill the surviving mutant with a genuine test (agent-principles #6).
 *
 * NO SCORES ARE DOCUMENTED HERE, ON PURPOSE. Mutation numbers are volatile — per-file
 * scores are scope-dependent (perTest attribution), and the overall score shifts as
 * code/tests change — so any figure written into this comment goes stale and becomes
 * proof-by-inference, the exact trap agent-principles #2/#3/#7 forbid (and the trap
 * that repeatedly tripped the review gate). The COMMAND is the single source of truth:
 * run `npm run mutate` for the current score, and see `reports/mutation` for per-mutant
 * detail. Report the scope you actually ran.
 *
 * DETERMINISM: the generous `timeoutMS`/`timeoutFactor` below make Killed-vs-Timeout
 * classification stable — genuine infinite-loop mutants still time out (a legitimate
 * kill), while slow-but-terminating mutants finish and reveal their true killed/survived
 * status — so the score no longer jitters red under machine load.
 *
 * RESIDUAL SURVIVORS are equivalent mutants (killing them would require asserting on
 * non-behavior). Described structurally, without counts, so this note can't go stale:
 *   - core: the capture bounds pre-guard in placePiece (off-board lookups already
 *     return `undefined`);
 *   - config: the two `readOverride` early-returns whose fall-through yields the same
 *     `undefined`;
 *   - sync.ts: error-MESSAGE string literals (the `SyncError` TYPE and its occurrence
 *     ARE asserted; only the human-readable message text is not) and the `case 'ignore'`
 *     no-op arm;
 *   - winLineLayout.ts: the empty `drawn` array passed to `generatePartialLine` (`[]` →
 *     `["Stryker was here"]`). The win line is never pre-registered, so any `drawn` list
 *     lacking the segment's canonical id yields identical behavior — an equivalent mutant
 *     (killing it would require asserting on a contrived id-collision, not real behavior).
 *     Kill genuine (non-equivalent) survivors with real tests; never suppress.
 *
 * Gate-rejection is re-proven on every review-gate run (agent-principles #7): temporarily
 * raising `break` above the current score makes `npm run mutate` exit non-zero.
 *
